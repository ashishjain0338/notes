# React-Notes

We grow and learn as we develop. The primary purpose of these notes is to capture the key concepts and practices I found essential at different stages of building React applications. While official documentation covers every aspect in detail, these notes focus specifically on the concepts I needed to understand and implement for my personal projects. This way, in the future, when starting a new frontend project, I can refer back to these notes and be ready to dive into development.
